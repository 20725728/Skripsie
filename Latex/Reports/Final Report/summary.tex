		\hline%=============================================================
		Navigation and Control of an Unmanned Surface Vessel.\\
		
		\hline%=============================================================
		\SumHead{Objectives}\\
		\hline%=============================================================
		The development of an independent navigation and control system that can be implemented on an unmanned surface vessel that uses electrical thrusters for propulsion and steering.\\
		
		\hline%=============================================================
		\SumHead{What is new in this project?}\\
		\hline%=============================================================
		A new control system is going to be created to control the power to the thrusters and thereby steer the vessel. Building on this a navigation system will be created so that the vessel can navigate to a designated point autonomously.\\
		
		\hline%=============================================================
		\SumHead{If the project is successful, how will it make a difference?}\\
		\hline%=============================================================
		With a successful navigation and control system, the system could be moved to vessels with better range and seafaring ability and these unmanned vessels can be used for research data collection, patrolling and search and rescue.\\
		
		\hline%=============================================================
		\SumHead{What contributions have/will other students made/make?}\\
		\hline%=============================================================
		N.A.\\
		
		\hline%=============================================================
		\SumHead{Which aspects of the project will carry on after completion and why}\\
		\hline%=============================================================
		For the vessel to be completely autonomous, a further project should investigate an obstacle avoidance system and power regeneration. This will be beneficial to avoid other sea vessels as well as fixed obstacles such as rocks and the shore. The power regeneration will extend the range of the vessel.\\
		
		\hline%=============================================================
		\SumHead{What arrangements have been/will be made to expedite contiuation?}\\
		\hline%=============================================================
		All the research and project documents will be archived with the university and the code-base will be thoroughly commented for ease of understanding.\\
