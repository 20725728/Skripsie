\chapter{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank both my parents for their support both financially and emotionally throughout my degree. I would also like to thank them for their inputs and proof reading of the final report. I would like to thank my uncle Barry Kingwill for his expertise in Naval Engineering and always being willing to consult and offer feedback. Thank you also to Oom Nico who was very accommodating with my work hours and fitting it all in with my project. Finally thank you to Prof. Versfeld for his guidance and feedback throughout the project.
