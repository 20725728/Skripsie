\chapter{Testing and Results}
In order to test the system a series of tests were conducted to test each system individually before the overall system was tested. The individual systems tested are the GPS and compass, the PWM output and Throttle, and the individual thrusters. Finally the full system was tested on the Stellenbosch canoe dam. 
\section{GPS and compass}
The GPS and compass were tested on land. A baseline was established using a tracking application on a cellphone. The GPS and compass together with the cellphone were placed in a bag and a route was walked. The tracking data from both sources can then be downloaded and formatted as a Keyhole Markup Language (.kml) file and displayed on a map. The accuracy of both the GPS and compass can also be determined. 
\section{PWM Output and Throttle}
In order to adjust the speed of the thrusters, the PWM output must vary based on the throttle input. The PWM signal can easily be measured using an oscilloscope, therefore the system was setup as shown in figure \ref{fig:4:PWMTest}. As the throttle is adjusted the PWM signal should vary. There are three distinct positions that can also be noted as in table \ref{tab:4:PWMpos}. Theses three positions were tested to ensure that the range of the throttle was correctly calibrated. Finally the PWM signal was observed while slowly adjusting the throttle to ensure that the PWM signal varied linearly and in with a timely response.
